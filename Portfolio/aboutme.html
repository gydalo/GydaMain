    <h2>Studies</h2>
    <p>When I was in school (videregående skole), I chose to study to become an electrician. After two years of schooling, I realized it wasn't the right fit for me and decided not to continue with the apprenticeship. Instead, I took supplementary studies (påbygg) to broaden my educational background. Despite this, I was still uncertain about what to study next.</p>

    <p>After taking a year off to work and gain some practical experience, I began a new educational journey in August 2017. I enrolled in a one-year program in Intercultural Communication and Global Cooperation at VID in Stavanger. </p>
        
    <p>The following year, I continued my studies at the University of South-Eastern Norway, focusing on sociology. This period allowed me to delve deeper into societal structures and human behavior. However, I soon realized that my passion lay more in the human side of things rather than the societal aspects.</p>
        
    <p>In August 2020, I decided to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Social Work at the University of Stavanger. This program resonated with my desire to make a positive impact on people's lives. I enjoyed my studies and the practical experience that came with it. However, as I progressed, I was introduced to front-end development and I really liked the thought of learning more about it.</p>
        
    <p>This led me to my current path. In August 2023, I began studying Front-End Development through Noroff's online studies. This field combines creativity with technical skills, giving room for trying out designing and making a page userfriendly. I am excited about the possibilities in front-end development and look forward to a career in it.</p>
