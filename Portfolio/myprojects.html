        <h2>Gamehub</h2>
        <p>Gamehub was my first project using CSS and HTML. I built a website for selling video games, complete with a fake shopping cart. This project was my first step in learning how to use CSS to create nice-looking websites. While it might not look great now, I'm proud of it because it was my starting point. I like looking back at it to see how much I've improved as a designer and developer.</p>

        <h2>Community Science Museum</h2>
        <p>This was my second project, where I also worked with just CSS and HTML. The goal was to create a website for a fictional museum. Through this project, I got a better understanding of how CSS works and how to make a webpage look and feel more like a real website. It's another project I look back on to see how far I've come and where I can still improve.</p>

        <h2>Rainy Days</h2>
        <p>Rainy Days was my first project using JavaScript. The task was to create a website for a store selling jackets, with a cart that saves items using local storage. I didn't have enough time to finish designing it, but I plan to finish the CSS soon. This project was a great learning experience in using JavaScript alongside HTML and CSS.</p>

        <h2>HotView Labs</h2>
        <p>HotView Labs is a simulated blog page for a tech firm, focusing on the latest tech gear. It includes login and registration features, so logged-in users can edit, delete, and post new content, while non-logged-in users can read the posts. This project was quite challenging, but I enjoyed it a lot. It made me learn more about using JavaScript and how to combine JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.</p>
