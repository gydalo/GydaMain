For my semester project, I designed a website for a fictional museum called Community Science Museum using Figma. Once satisfied with the design, I coded it using HTML and CSS. The website includes a homepage with a description of the museum, opening hours, a gallery, and sections for the shop, cafe, events, and contact information. The target audience is primary and middle school children and families with young children.

## Description

For my semester project, I designed and developed a website for a fictional museum called Community Science Museum.

### Design Phase:
Figma Design: I began by creating the design in Figma. This tool helped me visualize the layout, color scheme, and overall aesthetics of the website. The design was aimed at being engaging and accessible to our target audience.

### Development Phase:
HTML and CSS Coding: Once the design was finalized, I coded the website using HTML and CSS. My focus was on accurately translating the visual design into a functional web page while ensuring responsiveness. I also tried my best to follow the dry principle to make the code look nice and clean. 

### Features:
Homepage: The homepage provides an introduction to the museum, including a brief description, opening hours, and a gallery of exhibits.

Shop and Cafe: There are sections describing the museum shop and cafe, offering visitors an idea of what they can expect.

Events: The events page lists upcoming events and activities, helping families plan their visits around special exhibitions or workshops.

Contact Information: A contact page is included for visitors to get in touch with the museum.

### Target Audience:
Children and Families: The website is designed to be informative and visually appealing to children aged 7-15 and families with young children. The content is tailored to be accessible and engaging, ensuring that the museum's offerings are clearly communicated to this demographic.

This project helped me improve my design skills with Figma and my coding skills with HTML and CSS, resulting in a user-friendly website. It will also help me make make nicer looking design and clean CSS in future projects.
