In this course assignment, I created a game purchasing platform using HTML and CSS to learn the basics of CSS and web development. While not functional, it helped improve my skills in making visually appealing and well-structured web pages.

## Description

In this initial course assignment, I made a platform for purchasing games using HTML and CSS. The primary objective of this project was to gain a foundational understanding of CSS and its application in web development. While the platform does not include functional features, it serves as a practical exercise to enhance my skills in creating more visually appealing and structurally sound web pages in the future. This project allowed me to explore various CSS techniques, such as layout design, styling, and responsive web design, providing a solid groundwork for future, more complex projects.
