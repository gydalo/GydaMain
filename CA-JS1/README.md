"Rainy Days" is a project for a fake store called Rainy Days. It fetches product information from an API and includes a functional cart for adding and removing items. The checkout process clears the cart, although actual purchases are not processed. Design improvements are planned for the future.

## Description

"Rainy Days" is a fake web application that showcases the ability to fetch product data from an external API and manage a shopping cart. Users can easily add and remove items from their cart, with the current state saved in local storage. While the checkout process does not facilitate actual transactions, it simulates a purchase by clearing the cart upon clicking the checkout button. The design is still a work in progress, with plans to enhance its apperance in the near future. Despite its incomplete design, "Rainy Days" demonstrates functionalities and interactive features.
